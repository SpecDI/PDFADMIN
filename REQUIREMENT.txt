The requirement is a simple web application.

It provides user management with basic information (Name, email and password). Add, edit, delete functionality.

When a user login to the website, it is taken to main page which shows a table with list of user’s previously generated pdfs. The row will contain the link to the document, a title and a short description. At first, the table will be empty.

User will be offered with ‘Create pdf’ operation using which user will land to second page “Generation Form”.

The “Generation Form” page provides a hello message with a form that offers dynamic items with only text fields/area and their labels. After entering values, user can submit the form which is collected by the server and a pdf is created with some extra business logic. Open source library PDFBox can be used for this and some help can be provided as well.

User is then offered the response page which shows the generated pdf and provide an option to save with a short description. Upon saving, user is taken back to home page with the table containing also the newly created pdf as one of its rows.

The modern look and feel is important along with all the functionalities described.

MySQL database is preferred.

Any technology that can work with Java (to support PDFBox library integration) can be considered but Grails is preferred.
